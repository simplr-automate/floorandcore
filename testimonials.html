          <p class="testimonial-text">"Gabby Majcher works miracles! I just 'graduated' from pelvic floor physical therapy with Gabby who took me from an extremely concerned postpartum, first time mama to someone who now feels like a million bucks. Gabby took the time each session to fully understand my symptoms and concerns and made the exams very comfortable. Her PT plan for me showed improvement in my pelvic floor immediately and it gradually got better from there. She has excellent bedside manner and was a true pleasure to work with each week."</p>
