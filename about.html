      <h2>What is Floor and Core?</h2>
      <p>We provide personalized one-on-one pelvic floor physical therapy and group fitness tailored to your unique needs. Based in Hoboken, NJ, we also offer in-home sessions and virtual appointments for your convenience.</p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>EveryBODY has a pelvic floor — it's the foundation of our body, providing essential support for urinary, bowel, and sexual function. Over a lifetime, the pelvic floor can be impacted by pregnancy, postpartum changes, stress, and habitual patterns, often disrupting daily life. At Floor & Core, we take a science-based, whole-person approach — including the all-important core — to identify and address the root causes of dysfunction and help you return to the activities you love without fear.</p>
